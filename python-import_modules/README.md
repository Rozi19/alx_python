<h1><strong>Python - import & modules</strong></h1>
<h1>0. Import a simple function from a simple file</h1>
<br>
Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
<br>
You have to use print function with string format to display integers<br>
You have to assign:<br>
the value 1 to a variable called a<br>
the value 2 to a variable called b<br>
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print<br>
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2<br>
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
You can only use the word add_0 once in your code<br>
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__<br>
Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below
<br>
